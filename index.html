    <h3>HOW WE MET</h3>
    <p>It all began with a picture at He's Not Here. 

      Tyler and I were lucky enough to have mutual friends on the field hockey and baseball teams that introduced us in the Spring of 2014. Time went by and it wasn't until Fall of 2014, right before Thanksgiving break, that things sparked between us. Tyler randomly asked me to take a picture with him when a group of us were out at He's Not Here. To come full circle, this picture was taken by my neighbor and bridesmaid, Hannah Barreca, who went to the terrible school down the road, Duke. During finals week, we began to spend more time together. Over winter break, we talked everyday and got to know each other more. The first night back at UNC for the Spring 2015 semester, we went out on a Sunday night at He's Not. While at He's Not, Tyler told me that we were going to get married one day. I thought he was crazy, but I guess he was right. If you ask Tyler, he will still deny it to this day. 
      
      Two weeks later we went on our first date, and the rest is history.</p>

    <h3>HOW TYLER PROPOSED</h3>
    <h6>November 2, 2019</h6>
    <p>It was the Saturday night before my nursing school graduation. I was told we were going out to dinner to celebrate and then out with some friends. Little did I know, Tyler and our whole family had something else planned. Tyler, my best friend, Sarah, and I all left together to go to Tommy's for "dinner". A few minutes into the ride, we got a frantic call from my aunt saying they lost their new puppy on the beach and needed help finding her. Little did I know the dog was not lost, and my aunt had been practicing her frantic acting skills for weeks. After arriving at the beach club, Tyler led me down the stairs onto the sand and got down on one knee. It was the most perfect moment. Tyler even had a photographer that was hiding to capture it all. After the proposal, we went back to my house where our family was waiting for our surprise engagement party. I still don't know how Tyler and our family pulled this night off without me knowing, but everything was perfect.</p>
